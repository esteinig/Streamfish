# At this stage the basecalled reads may have differences in
# the simulated locations due to processing with Dorado, which
# may not call the exact number of bases as indicated by the 
# simulated read. This means that we need to basecall first 
# and then correct the basecalled reads to the correct
# abundance; because this may introduce slight variation
# in which reads are used anyway, we let Dorado output the
# reads (in order that may not match the input signal reads)
# and we produce two subset files of the simualted reads meta
# data: one for the corrected signal and one for the corrected
# basecalls.

# Final community signal CAN be rebasecalled, but due to 
# variations in Dorado read length output for the merged
# signal simulations (which is trimmed to exact abundance) 
# it may slightly over or undercall total expected bases 
# for each member, this can be done from the final community 
# POD5 file if an exact abundance is not required
