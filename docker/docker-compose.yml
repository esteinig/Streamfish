  # This builds a development container which mirrors the repository 
  # for cargo-watch auto-building on every change during development.
  #
  # We must build the containers with the UID and GID specified in the environment file
  # and run the containers with these variables as well - this allows permissions to be
  # shared correctly between user and host
  #
  # docker-compose --env-file .env -f docker-compose.yml --profile dev --project-name <project> up [--build]
  
  # This development container requires MinKNOW to run on the host, it will
  # map the host ports into the container on `minknow_host` so that we can
  # connect to the MinKNOW API. This requires to set the configuration 
  # environmental variable:
  #
  # STREAMFISH_MINKNOW_HOST=minknow_host
  #
  # This is done here with the environment variable which overrides the
  # configuration file (.env) from the shared directory tree.
