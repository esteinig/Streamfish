  # This builds a development container which mirrors the repository 
  # for cargo-watch auto-building on every change during development.
  #
  # We must build the containers with the UID and GID specified in the environment file
  # and run the containers with these variables as well - this allows permissions to be
  # shared correctly between user and host
  #
  # docker-compose --env-file .env -f docker-compose.yml --profile dev --project-name <project> up [--build]
  
  # This development container requires MinKNOW to run on the host, it will
  # map the host ports into the container on `minknow_host` so that we can
  # connect to the MinKNOW API. This requires to set the configuration 
  # environmental variable:
  #
  # STREAMFISH_MINKNOW_HOST=minknow_host
  #
  # This is done here with the environment variable which overrides the
  # configuration file (.env) from the shared directory tree.
  #
  # At the moment the setup requires the ReadUntil client to run on the
  # host - this is due to mounting the UDS path for the Dori connection
  # into the container from the host to enable faster data transfer!

  # Dori container with mounted host paths and ports

  # Note that when the GPU does not have sufficient free memory (hard to tell how much) for example
  # when `guppy_basecall_server` is running concurrently, then Dorado basecalling may result in weird 
  # CUDA and segfaults - these are usually fixed by clearing the stupid auto-run of Guppy from the GPU
  # and making memory available (tested on a RTX 3060 Driver: 470.182.03 with CUDNN8 and CUDA 11.4.3)

  # In fact it seems unrelated to GPU MEM usage? Errors can occur on intitial execution of Dorado,
  # something causes this to be unstable. I can't pinpoint it because it seems to occurr randomly,
  # usually after starting the container, and then disappears after a couple of test runs? Might
  # just not be very stable on my GPU

  # This container must be run with correct host user permissions ecause running the server inside
  # creates the UDS path that should be accessible for the streamfish readuntil client which is
  # excuted on host
